"""
Mnemosyne Veracity-Weighted Consolidation
=========================================
Our novel contribution: Bayesian confidence scoring + conflict resolution.

Veracity tiers:
- stated:     1.0  (user explicitly stated)
- inferred:   0.7  (inferred from context)
- tool:       0.5  (tool output, may be stale)
- imported:   0.6  (imported from external source)
- unknown:    0.8  (default, unverified)

Bayesian updating:
- confidence = 1 - (0.7^n) where n = mention count
- More mentions = higher confidence
- Contradictions detected and flagged

Conflict resolution:
- Same subject + predicate = potential conflict
- Higher confidence wins
- Lower confidence flagged for review
- Consolidation: periodic synthesis of high-confidence facts

def aggregate_veracity(source_veracities) -> str:
    """E4.a.1: aggregate per-source veracity labels into one summary label.

    Used at consolidation time when a `sleep()` summarizes N working_memory
    rows into one episodic_memory row. Pre-fix the episodic INSERT didn't
    set the veracity column, so it defaulted to 'unknown' (0.8 multiplier)
    even when every source row was 'stated' (1.0). That destroys the
    trust signal `remember_batch` had populated per-row.

    Aggregation rule (mode + conservative tie-breaking):
        - Empty / no-valid-labels input → 'unknown' (matches schema default)
        - Single distinct label → that label
        - Clear majority → the majority label
        - Multi-way tie → the label with the LOWEST weight (most conservative)

    Rationale: a summary inherits the confidence of its sources collectively.
    Homogeneous-stated sources should produce a stated summary (don't
    overclaim by inflating, don't underclaim by deflating). Mixed sources
    should produce a label that reflects the most-common signal. Tied
    multi-way sources resolve toward caution rather than overclaiming.

    Non-canonical labels in input (e.g., raw LLM output bleeding through
    a caller's clamp) are silently dropped from the count — operators
    rely on `clamp_veracity()` at the trust boundary; the aggregator is
    not a clamp, it's a reducer.

    Args:
        source_veracities: iterable of veracity strings (typically from
            a SELECT on working_memory.veracity for source rows).

        One canonical veracity label (member of VERACITY_ALLOWED).
